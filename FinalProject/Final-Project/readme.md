So in my Final Project Theres Is:
1.An Interactive Homepage
2.An Education Page detailing my basic highschool/college education
3.A Skills page detailing relevant skills and qualifications
4.A Projects page showing previous works/my portfolio
5.A contact page for basic info
This entire website should be servicable when completed, and may even include darkmode as writing.

Features Include:
Dynamic UI
Imbedded Links
Images
Built in contact bubble (possibly)
Dark Mode implementation (possibly)
Database implementation
Tailwindcss usage

Setup is easy, just download the files and run the start up server command in the command prompt and it should prove operational, I intend to use mongodb for implementation
